# GPX_add_timestamp
Add timestamp into the GPX file that do not have timestamps at points.

# Purpose:
To automately produce a hiking video from the web service in the Relive, a website people shared their hiking, running, or bicycling route, by uploading a GPX file to this website or APP, we should have a GPX file having continuous timestamps in the sequencial GPX points.

Although our bureau had a lot of GPX files, these files are modified for people's safe. As a result, our GPX files' timestamps lost.
Instead of typing timestamps hand by hand, I created this python program to add continuous timestamps automately.
This program save my collegue and I a lot of time. If I did not have this programe, I would spend about 4 hours each GPX.
